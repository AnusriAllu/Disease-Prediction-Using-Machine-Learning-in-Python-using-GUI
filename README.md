 Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning In Python Using GUI
     

    
Today's people are likely addicted to the internet but they are not concerned about their physical health. People ignore the small problem and donâ€™t visit the hospital which turns into a serious disease with time. Taking the advantage of this growing technology, This project's basic aim is to develop a system that will predict the disease by symptoms put down by the patients without visiting the hospitals/physicians. It is very crucial to know if we are suffering from a disease, at an early stage rather than discovering it at a later stage. Hence disease prediction system plays an important role as it predicts the diseases based on symptoms. The Disease Prediction system is based on predictive modeling that predicts the disease of the user based on the symptoms that the user provides as an input to the system. The system analyses the symptoms provided by the user as input and gives the disease name as an output. Disease Prediction is done by using the machine learning algorithm named Random Forest. The project uses Python Tkinter GUI for the user interface.
